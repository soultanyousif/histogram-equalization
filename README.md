# Histogram Equalizatio
Histogram Equalization is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in images. It
accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e. stretching out the
intensity range of the image. This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable
data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher
contrast.
